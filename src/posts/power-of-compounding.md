Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are a powerful tool for wealth creation, largely due to the principle of compounding. Learn how consistent, disciplined investing can turn small savings into a substantial corpus over time.

### How Compounding Works in SIPs
Compounding in SIPs means that you not only earn returns on your principal investment but also on the accumulated returns. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown:

1.  **Regular Investments**: You invest a fixed amount at regular intervals (usually monthly).
2.  **Purchase Units**: Each investment buys you a certain number of mutual fund units at the current Net Asset Value (NAV).
3.  **Earn Returns**: The value of these units grows as the market performs.
4.  **Reinvested Gains**: The gains are automatically reinvested, buying more units and creating a snowball effect that significantly boosts your wealth over the long term.

This disciplined approach helps you benefit from market volatility through **Rupee Cost Averaging** and harnesses the true power of compounding.
